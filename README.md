# translation_using_word_embeddings

![Model](./images/image_explanation.png)

Repo for a translation project using word embeddings. The goal is to be able to translate from one language to another using supervised methods (with the presence of a translation dictionnary) and unsupervised methods (using an generative adversarial network to train our model). See [Word Translation without Parallel Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04087.pdf) for more details).

Useful documentation will be stored in the `/articles` folder.

- The report is named `report.pdf`.
- The slides are stored as `presentation_slides.pdf`.
- The code is stored in the folder `./Code_notebook `, as a Jupyter notebook importing some functions from other files in that very same folder.
- Some training results that take a lot of time to obtain are stored in training_results.
